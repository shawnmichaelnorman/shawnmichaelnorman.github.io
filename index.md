This is a blog to chronicle the Tale of the Technobard.

A Technobard is someone who is the jack of all trades (as it pertains to technology) but the master of none. 

Most of this tale will consist of documenting the homelab. Other posts may include other aspects of life or projects. It may also include other short stories.
