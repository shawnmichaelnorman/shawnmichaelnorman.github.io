#This is my first blog post about my github page.

Today I started building my github page. I don't have any experience with github, but 
everything I am trying to do on my homelab requires github.

The first thing is, I want to document everything I am doing. 
I figure github is the way since many of the projects I am working on can be forked to 
my github page and tailored (once I figure out what I am doing).

The plan is to build things in the most efficient order I can (based on my current knowledge).
There are so many things that can be built on my homelab, but I am trying to build them 
in an intuitive order.

My idea is to follow this path (until I learn otherwise):

1. Setup github page
2. Setup blog page (what I am typing into now).
3. Setup homelab (the homelab details will be on another blog post).
4. Learn things
5. Continue to document/blog
